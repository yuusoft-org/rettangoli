# Description

we want to not comment the video tests in route-graphics
we just want to specify somewhere in config that vt report should skip them for reporting and screenshotting.

# Implementation

Added `skipScreenshot: true` option to config sections and items. When a section or item is marked with `skipScreenshot: true`:

1. **Screenshot generation is skipped** - Files in skipped sections won't have screenshots taken
2. **Report automatically excludes skipped items** - Since no screenshots are generated, they won't appear in report comparisons
3. **HTML files and sidebar still include all sections** - The overview pages and sidebar will still show all items

## Usage

### Skip an entire group section:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Primitives"
      type: "groupLabel"
      skipScreenshot: true  # Skip all items in this group
      items:
        - title: "Button"
          files: "primitives/button"
```

### Skip individual items:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Components"
      type: "groupLabel"
      items:
        - title: "Select"
          files: "components/select"
        - title: "Waveform"
          files: "components/waveform"
          skipScreenshot: true  # Skip only this item
```

### Skip flat sections:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Todos"
      files: "pages/todos"
      skipScreenshot: true  # Skip this section
```

### Skip individual spec files (frontmatter):
```yaml
---
title: "My Test"
skipScreenshot: true
---
<rtgl-view>...</rtgl-view>
```

## Files Modified

- `packages/rettangoli-vt/src/common.js` - Added `getSkippedFilePaths()` and `isPathSkipped()` helper functions
- `packages/rettangoli-vt/src/cli/generate.js` - Filter out skipped files before taking screenshots
