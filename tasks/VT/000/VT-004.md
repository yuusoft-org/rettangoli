# Description

we want to not comment the video tests in route-graphics
we just want to specify somewhere in config that vt report should skip them for reporting and screenshotting.

# Implementation

Added `skipScreenshot: true` option in spec file frontmatter. When a file has `skipScreenshot: true` in its frontmatter:

1. **Screenshot generation is skipped** - The file won't have screenshots taken
2. **Report automatically excludes skipped items** - Since no screenshots are generated, they won't appear in report comparisons
3. **HTML files and sidebar still include all files** - The overview pages and sidebar will still show all items

## Usage

### Skip individual spec files (frontmatter):
```yaml
---
title: "My Test"
skipScreenshot: true
---
<rtgl-view>...</rtgl-view>
```

## Files Modified

- `packages/rettangoli-vt/src/cli/generate.js` - Filter out files with `skipScreenshot: true` in frontmatter before taking screenshots
