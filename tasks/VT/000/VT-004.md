# Description

we want to not comment the video tests in route-graphics
we just want to specify somewhere in config that vt report should skip them for reporting and screenshotting.

# Implementation

Added `skip: true` option to config sections and items. When a section or item is marked with `skip: true`:

1. **Screenshot generation is skipped** - Files in skipped sections won't have screenshots taken
2. **Report excludes skipped items** - Skipped screenshots won't be compared or show up as mismatches
3. **HTML files and sidebar still include skipped sections** - The overview pages and sidebar will still show all items, only screenshot generation and report comparison are skipped

## Usage

### Skip an entire group section:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Primitives"
      type: "groupLabel"
      skip: true  # Skip all items in this group
      items:
        - title: "Button"
          files: "primitives/button"
```

### Skip individual items:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Components"
      type: "groupLabel"
      items:
        - title: "Select"
          files: "components/select"
        - title: "Waveform"
          files: "components/waveform"
          skip: true  # Skip only this item
```

### Skip flat sections:
```yaml
vt:
  sections:
    - title: "Todos"
      files: "pages/todos"
      skip: true  # Skip this section
```
