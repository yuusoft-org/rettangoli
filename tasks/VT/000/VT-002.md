title: Fix dialog screenshot generation inconsistency

# Description

## Context

- In rettangoli-ui we run `bun run vt:generate` which generates screenshots
- However, the screenshots generated for dialog, is sometimes inconsistent and the generated image is not 100% the same. This is not idea.
  - this happens because for the `rtgl-dialog`, there is a small css animation to show the dialog
- We have tried to add delay like 500ms before doing the screenshot, but it still does not generate consistent screenshots.
