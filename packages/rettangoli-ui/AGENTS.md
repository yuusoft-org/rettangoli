# AGENTS Guide: `packages/rettangoli-ui`

This package now maintains a single contract document:
- `packages/rettangoli-ui/DEVELOPMENT.md`

Use `DEVELOPMENT.md` for:
- interface consistency rules
- FE component contract rules
- runtime attrs/props/event semantics
- required validation commands and change flow

Canonical FE docs still take precedence:
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/overview.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/view.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/store.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/handlers.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/schema.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/methods.md`
- `packages/rettangoli-fe/docs/constants.md`

If `packages/rettangoli-ui/DEVELOPMENT.md` conflicts with FE docs, FE docs win.
