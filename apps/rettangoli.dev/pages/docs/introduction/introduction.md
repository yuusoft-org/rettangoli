*Rettangoli* means *rectangles* in Italian.

Rettangoli is a UI library with a small yet practical API designed for building modern web applications efficiently.

## Core Philosophy

The essence of Rettangoli is to expose a minimal set of APIs that cover the most common UI development needs. This approach offers several key benefits:

* **Quick to learn and intuitive to use**: We set sensible defaults whenever possible, reducing the learning curve
* **Opinionated structure**: Provides consistency through established patterns while being flexible in branding - you can bring your own theme
* **Comprehensive component library**: We will provide many opinionated components that will be sufficient to build most applications

## Current Limitations

Please be aware of the following current limitations:

* **Accessibility**: Accessibility features are not currently implemented but may be improved in future releases
* **SEO**: SEO functionality likely works for most use cases but is not actively supported or tested
