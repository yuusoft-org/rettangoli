> Your layout is basically made out of rectangular shapes

rettangoli is a layout and UI library that you can learn within one day and use for the rest of your life

## Learn within one day

* We expose a small opinioned API we think can satisfy 95% of web layout needs. For the remaining 5%, you can keep using CSS.
* Default behavior should satisfy the most common use case
* Using the library should feel intutitive, especially if you have previous experience with web UI development

## Use for the rest of your life

* It uses web components. It should run as long as web components are supported
* Small API means we have less surface to maintain
* Extensive test cases to ensure that the library just works and not unexpected behavior is introduced
