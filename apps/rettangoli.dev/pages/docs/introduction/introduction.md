> The layout is basically made out of rectangles

*Rettangoli* means *rectangles* in Italian.

Rettangoli is a layout and UI library with a small yet practical API designed for building modern web applications efficiently.

## Core Philosophy

The essence of Rettangoli is to expose a minimal set of APIs that cover the most common UI development needs. This approach offers several key benefits:

* **Quick to learn and intuitive to use**: We set sensible defaults whenever possible, reducing the learning curve
* **Stable API**: The small, focused API surface is easier to maintain and keep stable over time
* **Robust implementation**: A smaller API allows for more comprehensive testing and reliability
* **Portable across environments**: The API is compact enough that it can be easily reimplemented in different environments and platforms

## Motivation

CSS has evolved over many decades. Being a protocol, it must maintain backward compatibility, resulting in an extensive API. While this is appropriate for a general purpose language, the vast API makes it unnecessarily complex for typical application development.

After building UI applications for over a decade, I've developed an understanding of which features are commonly used and which are rarely needed in day to day development.

Rettangoli embodies the "less is more" principle: our goal is to provide just 5% of the API surface that covers 95% of real-world use cases. This focused approach leads to:

* **Faster development**: Less time spent learning API details means more time building features
* **More consistent UIs**: A constrained API naturally guides developers toward consistent patterns
* **Better performance**: A streamlined library with fewer features can be optimized more effectively

## Who Should Use Rettangoli

Rettangoli is ideal for:
* Frontend developers looking for a lightweight alternative to complex UI frameworks
* Teams that value consistency and simplicity in their UI development
* Applications that want to minimize external dependencies
