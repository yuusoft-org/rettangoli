Use this when your app is generated by `rtgl sites` and you want VT with no custom JavaScript and local-versioned CLI usage through package scripts.

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "rtgl sites watch -p 4173 -o dist --quiet",
    "build": "rtgl sites build -o dist",
    "generate": "rtgl vt generate",
    "report": "rtgl vt report",
    "accept": "rtgl vt accept"
  }
}
```

## Minimal setup

`rettangoli.config.yaml`:

```yaml
vt:
  path: ./vt
  url: http://127.0.0.1:4173
  service:
    start: npm run watch
  sections:
    - title: pages
      files: pages
```

## Why this command

- `watch` runs `rtgl sites watch`, which does initial build, serves output, and stays running.
- VT can start/stop it automatically via `vt.service.start`.
- `build` runs a production output build with `rtgl sites build -o dist`.
- Scripts use the project-local `rtgl` binary.

## Run VT

```bash
npm run generate
npm run report
npm run accept
```

## Notes

- Keep `vt.url` and `-p` on the same port.
- `-o dist` is optional; default output is `_site`.
- If your preview server is already running elsewhere, you can omit `vt.service` and keep only `vt.url`.
